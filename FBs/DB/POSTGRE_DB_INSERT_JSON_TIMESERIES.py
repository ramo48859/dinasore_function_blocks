"""
This block will insert a JSON timeseries from the MEASUREMENTS_TO_JSON_TIMESERIES fblock into a PostgreSQL
DB. The format of the table used to insert originally was:
timeseries_index|timestamp|measuremnt

# ATENTION! First install dependencies (example for Linux): 
# sudo apt install python3-dev libpq-dev
# pip install psycopg2

# Error handling took from: https://kb.objectrocket.com/postgresql/python-error-handling-with-the-psycopg2-postgresql-adapter-645
# Error handling must be improved, not working with queries

Input format from MEASUREMENTS_TO_JSON_TIMESERIES fblock:

{
    "columns": ["sensor","measurement"],
    "index": ["2017-01-01T12:00:00.000000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:00.300000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:00.600000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:00.900000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:01.200000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:01.500000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:01.800000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:02.100000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:02.400000Z","2017-01-01T12:00:02.700000Z"],
